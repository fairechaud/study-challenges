Write an SQL query that filters the 'hobby_expenses' table for rows where the "Hobby" is "Video Games" and the "Date" falls within July. You can then use the SQL `SUM` function to calculate the total expense. Here's the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT SUM(Expense) AS TotalExpenseInJuly FROM hobby_expenses WHERE Hobby = 'Video Games' AND DATE >= '2023-07-01' AND DATE <= '2023-07-31'; ``` This query selects the sum of the "Expense" column for rows where the "Hobby" is "Video Games" and the "Date" is in the range of July 2023. It then uses the `SUM(Expense)` function to calculate the total expense for the "Video Games" hobby in July. The result will give you the total amount you spent on the "Video Games" hobby in July. user: That's great. Now write a SQL query to find how much I have spent on each hobby in total. model: OK, to find out how much you've spent on each hobby in total from the 'hobby_expenses' table, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT Hobby, SUM(Expense) AS TotalExpense FROM hobby_expenses GROUP BY Hobby; ``` This query selects the "Hobby" column and calculates the total expense for each hobby by summing the "Expense" column. It then groups the results by the "Hobby" column, providing you with the total expenses for each hobby. user: I need to add more to the table. Add a new category called "Crafts", and then enter the following entries into the table: February 25th I spent £25 on paper supplies March 20th I spent £100 on a vinyl cutting machine May 10th I spent £80 on vinyl model: Sure, here's the SQL code to add the new "Crafts" category and the specified entries to your 'hobby_expenses' table: ```sql INSERT INTO hobby_expenses (Date, Hobby, Expense, Description) VALUES ('2023-02-25', 'Crafts', 25, 'Paper supplies'), ('2023-03-20', 'Crafts', 100, 'Vinyl cutting machine'), ('2023-05-10', 'Crafts', 80, 'Vinyl'); ``` This SQL code inserts three rows of expense data into the 'hobby_expenses' table for the hobby "Crafts" on different dates, each with its corresponding expense and description. user: That's good, but the data has been added to the end of the table. How can I view the data in chronological order?
