Certainly! Lamport's logical clock is a mechanism used in distributed systems to order events in a way that respects the causal relationships between them.

The basic idea behind Lamport's logical clock is quite simple:

Each process in the system maintains a logical clock, which is essentially just a counter.
Whenever a process does work (an "internal event"), it increments its logical clock.
When a process sends a message to another process, it includes its logical clock value in the message.
When a process receives a message, it updates its logical clock to be greater than both its own current value and the value in the received message.
Let's simulate this with a simple C program. The program will have two processes (simulated as functions) that communicate through messages:
