This program defines three functions:

event() - This function increments the global lamport_clock variable by 1 and prints a message.
*send_message(int timestamp) - This function sets the timestamp variable to the current value of the lamport_clock, increments the lamport_clock by 1, and prints a message.
receive_message(int timestamp) - This function sets the lamport_clock to the maximum of the current value of the lamport_clock and the timestamp parameter, and then increments the lamport_clock by 1. It prints a message as well.
The main() function then simulates some events by calling these functions. You can modify the program to simulate other events, such as sending and receiving messages between different processes. A few important points about the program include:

The initial value of the lamport_clock variable is 0
Each internal event increments the lamport_clock variable by 1
When a message is sent, the lamport_clock variable is incremented by 1 and the timestamp is set to the current value of the lamport_clock
When a message is received, the lamport_clock variable is set to the maximum of the current value of the lamport_clock and the timestamp of the message, and then incremented by 1
If the physical clock is used to timestamp events, there might be inconsistencies due to clock drift or synchronization issues on different nodes
Lamport's logical clock is a simple and easy-to-implement algorithm that can be used to timestamp events in a distributed system
It can be used to order events that occur on different nodes
Lamport's logical clock does not guarantee that events will be causally ordered
It is possible for two events to have the same timestamp even if they occurred in different orders
