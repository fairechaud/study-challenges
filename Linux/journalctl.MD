# How to Use journalctl to See Logs for a Failed Service
If a service has failed on your system, you can use the journalctl command to view its logs and troubleshoot the issue. Here's how:

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Use the following command to view all logs for the service:

```
journalctl -u service-name.service
```

Replace service-name.service with the actual name of the service that failed. For example, to view logs for the Apache web server, you would use the following command:

```
journalctl -u apache2.service
```

3. Use the -b option to view only logs from the current boot:

```
journalctl -b -u service-name.service
```

This can be helpful if you want to avoid seeing older logs that are unrelated to the current issue.

4. Use the -p option to filter logs by priority level:

```
journalctl -u service-name.service -p err
```

This will only show logs that are at the error level or above.

5. Use the -f option to follow the logs in real-time:

```
journalctl -u service-name.service -f
```

This can be helpful if you are trying to troubleshoot an issue that is happening right now.

6. Use the --since and --until options to view logs from a specific time period:

```
journalctl -u service-name.service --since "2023-12-06 15:00" --until "2023-12-06 16:00"
```

This will only show logs that were generated between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM on December 6th, 2023.

Here are some additional tips for using journalctl:

You can use the -o option to specify the output format of the logs. For example, the following command will output the logs in JSON format:

```
journalctl -u service-name.service -o json
```

You can use the -g option to group the logs by unit. This can be helpful if you want to see all of the logs for a specific unit, such as a service or a systemd timer.

You can use the -e option to show the exit code of the service. This can be helpful for troubleshooting issues that are caused by the service exiting unexpectedly.
